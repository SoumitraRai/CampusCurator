## Key Business Features

### 1. **Invitation-Based Group Formation**
- **How it works:** Group leader creates group → Gets unique code → Shares with teammates → They join using code
- **Business benefit:** Eliminates manual group registration, prevents duplicate entries
- **Constraint:** Students can join only ONE drive (prevents over-commitment)

### 2. **Smart Mentor Allocation**
- **Manual mode:** Admin reviews preferences and assigns individually
- **Auto mode:** Algorithm considers preferences, capacity, and workload balance
- **Business benefit:** Saves hours of manual work, ensures fair distribution
- **Constraint:** Mentors have maximum capacity (typically 6 groups)

### 3. **Multi-Stage Workflow**
- **Stages:** Drive Creation → Group Formation → Mentor Allotment → Synopsis → Checkpoints → Results
- **Business benefit:** Structured progression, clear accountability
- **Flexibility:** Stages can be enabled/disabled based on needs

### 4. **Synopsis Review Workflow**
- **Process:** Submit → Review → Approve/Reject/Revise → Resubmit if needed
- **Business benefit:** Quality control, mentor-student collaboration
- **Feature:** Version control tracks all revisions

### 5. **Checkpoint Evaluations**
- **Multiple checkpoints:** Mid-sem, End-sem, or custom
- **Criteria-based scoring:** Customizable evaluation parameters
- **Auto-grading:** Marks → Percentage → Grade (A+ to F)
- **Business benefit:** Consistent evaluation, detailed feedback

### 6. **Automated Result Compilation**
- **Components:** Logbook + Synopsis + Report + PPT + Mid-sem + End-sem
- **Auto-calculation:** Total marks, percentage, grade, pass/fail status
- **Business benefit:** Instant results, no manual calculation errors
